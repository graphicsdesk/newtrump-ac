                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">In the wake of a Nov. 7, 2024, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/teens-arrested-charged-in-harlem-shooting-of-7-year-old-girl-police-say">shooting</a> that injured a seven-year-old girl near Hamilton Heights, a local organizer said he planned to hold a town hall with residents to discuss public safety amid heightened community fears and media coverage.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">More than a year later, Ryan Bauer-Walsh, a West Harlem resident and community organizer who was planning the meeting, said the public town hall has yet to materialize due to what he characterized as scheduling conflicts between organizers and local officials.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Bauer-Walsh and other residents and local leaders in the neighborhood characterized it as a missed opportunity for community engagement in Upper Manhattan—an area that residents have said is overlooked by public officials, especially when compared to Midtown and Lower Manhattan.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">“I can&rsquo;t imagine why in an election year it wasn&rsquo;t looked on as an incredibly valuable opportunity to engage with constituents,” Bauer-Walsh wrote in a statement to Spectator.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">According to Bauer-Walsh, he met District 7 City Councilmember Shaun Abreu, CC &rsquo;14, and Precinct 30 Captain Cary Rose at The Chipped Cup, a Hamilton Heights coffee shop, just a few days after the shooting.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">The shooting took place near Hamilton Heights but not directly within the area, meaning it was not within either official&rsquo;s jurisdiction. However, Bauer-Walsh said the event shook Hamilton Heights community members. More New York Police Department officers were <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-deploys-more-police-to-harlem-after-daytime-shooting-injures-7-year-old">deployed</a> to the area in the days following the incident.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Bauer-Walsh wrote in a statement to Spectator that he hoped to help host two town halls, the first of which was planned for January at the latest. According to Bauer-Walsh, the first town hall was supposed to be a “grassroots initiative” for local leaders to collaborate on how to “spread accurate information” related to the shooting.</p>

                <div class="flex h-[75svh] items-center justify-center md:flex-none md:h-auto md:items-start md:justify-start md:p-0 md:w-full p-4">
                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">The second town hall would have been a public forum, open for residents to ask questions and get answers from public officials about public safety and other neighborhood issues. But January passed, and he said the first town hall had not taken place.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="flex h-[75svh] items-center justify-center md:flex-none md:h-auto md:items-start md:justify-start md:p-0 md:w-full p-4">
                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">A public safety meeting with local leaders was held on April 7, with Abreu in attendance, according to a photo and statements shared by representatives from Abreu&rsquo;s office. Bauer-Walsh said he was unable to attend this meeting. The second town hall, which would have featured community residents, was not held, according to Bauer-Walsh.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Bauer-Walsh said he worried the cancellation made him look “like a liar at worst- and untrustworthy and incompetent at best.”</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Hamilton Heights resident Laura Davis agreed. Though she said she thought the town hall was a good idea when she first heard of it, she said she felt somewhat cynical too. “I&rsquo;m not surprised to hear it didn&rsquo;t happen,” she said.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">She said that a town hall would have been crucial in the direct aftermath of the shooting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="flex h-[75svh] items-center justify-center md:flex-none md:h-auto md:items-start md:justify-start md:p-0 md:w-full p-4">
                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">“I think that would have been really, really helpful, honestly, because there&rsquo;s so many families uptown,” Davis said. “This is a family neighborhood. There&rsquo;s so many families in this neighborhood. There&rsquo;s so many schools, there&rsquo;s so many kids and grandparents and aunts and uncles and parents like myself.”</p>

                <div class="flex h-[75svh] items-center justify-center md:flex-none md:h-auto md:items-start md:justify-start md:p-0 md:w-full p-4">
                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Both Davis and Bauer-Walsh expressed dismay at Abreu&rsquo;s alleged decision not to follow up on the town hall. Though up for reelection for his City Council seat in November, Abreu won soundly against Independent candidate Edafe Okporo.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="flex h-[75svh] items-center justify-center md:flex-none md:h-auto md:items-start md:justify-start md:p-0 md:w-full p-4">

She said Abreu did not directly condemn the detention of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, SIPA &rsquo;24, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the days directly after his March arrest. Abreu <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/11/columbia-and-barnard-faculty-condemn-arrest-of-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-sipa-24-at-press-conference/">spoke at a rally</a> criticizing Khalil&rsquo;s arrest, where he condemned both ICE and the Trump administration.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Victor Edwards, the chair of CB9, said he has had a good relationship with Rose, who took on the position of precinct captain last year. Edwards said Rose or another precinct officer usually sits in on CB9 meetings.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">“Captain Rose is probably one of the best commanders that I&rsquo;ve worked with since I&rsquo;ve been on the board,” Edwards said. “He is very accessible to me personally.”</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Edwards said the town hall likely did not impact a majority of West Harlem residents since many did not know it was happening to begin with. But, he added, a public town hall may be helpful in the wake of traumatic, confusing events such as the shooting.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">“I think it helps reassure residents that someone is looking out for their interests, and they can express what their fears are, and even bring to the attention of local officials or the precinct where they see things that could be improved or need more patrolling and things of this nature,” Edwards said. “I think it lets people know that they care.”</p>

                    <p class="bg-white md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg">Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the shooting happened within Hamilton Heights and that a public safety meeting with local leaders did not happen on April 7. The shooting happened near Hamilton Heights but not in the jurisdiction of the neighborhood. The public safety meeting with local leaders on April 7 did occur. The article also incorrectly stated that District 7 City Councilmember Shaun Abreu did not directly condemn the arrest of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil in the days following Khalil&rsquo;s arrest. Abreu did condemn the arrest of Khalil in at least one instance. Spectator regrets these errors.</p>
